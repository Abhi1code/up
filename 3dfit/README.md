# 3D Fitting to 91 Keypoints

This implements the 3D fitting to 14 or 91 keypoints with the SMPLify fitting
objective, currently without the silhouette fitting objective due to licensing
issues. The code is based on the [http://smplify.is.tuebingen.mpg.de](SMPLify
code). If you find it useful for your research, please consider also citing
